Solving the Example “John Gives Mary a Book” Using Three Different Knowledge Representation (KR) Algorithms

The sentence “John gives Mary a book” can be represented and solved using different KR techniques. Below, we apply First-Order Logic (FOL), Conceptual Graphs (CGs), and Frame-Based Representation to this example.

1. First-Order Logic (FOL) Representation

FOL provides a precise, symbolic way to represent knowledge and infer new facts using logical rules.

Representation in FOL:

We define the relationships between entities using predicates:
	•	Entities: Person(John), Person(Mary), Book(B1)
	•	Relations: Gives(John, Mary, B1), where John is the giver, Mary is the recipient, and B1 is the book.

Formal FOL Representation:
1.	John and Mary are people:
Person(John), Person(Mary)
2.	B1 is a book:
Book(B1)

3.	John gives Mary a book:
Gives(John,Mary,B1)

4.	Inference Rule (e.g., ownership transfer):
If Gives(X, Y, Z), then Owns(Y, Z).

*X,Y,Z (Gives(X,Y,Z) = Owns(Y,Z)
5.	Inference Result:

Since Gives(John, Mary, B1) holds, we can infer:
Owns(Mary,B1)
(Mary now owns the book after John gives it to her.)

Strengths: Logical rigor, inference rules allow deriving new knowledge.
❌ Limitations: Requires a reasoner to process rules and deduce new facts.

2. Conceptual Graphs (CGs) Representation

Conceptual graphs are a structured way of representing meaning visually.

Graph Representation:
	•	Nodes: Represent entities (Person: John, Person: Mary, Book: B1)
	•	Edges (Relations): Gives, Agent, Recipient, Object

Graph Diagram Representation (Text-Based):

[Person: John] → (Agent) → [Give] → (Object) → [Book: B1]
                           ↓ 
                        (Recipient) → [Person: Mary]

How It Works:
	1.	John is the agent of the action Give
	2.	The action Give has an object Book: B1
	3.	The recipient of the action is Mary

 Strengths:
	•	Visually intuitive
	•	Can be transformed into logical statements
	•	Useful in semantic web applications

 Limitations:
	•	Requires a formal parser to process
	•	Harder to automate reasoning than FOL

3. Frame-Based Representation

Frames are structured data templates used in AI to represent objects, properties, and relations.

Frame Representation for “John Gives Mary a Book”:

A frame contains slots (attributes) and values.

Frame for Give-Event

Frame: Give-Event
  Agent: John
  Recipient: Mary
  Object: Book (B1)
  Time: [T1]
  Status: Completed

Frame for Person: John

Frame: Person
  Name: John
  Role: Giver
  Owns: { }

Frame for Person: Mary

Frame: Person
  Name: Mary
  Role: Receiver
  Owns: {B1}

How It Works:
	1.	John starts with no book in his Owns slot.
	2.	After Give-Event execution, Book: B1 is removed from John and added to Mary.
	3.	The status of the event changes to Completed.
 Strengths:
	•	Can store structured, hierarchical knowledge
	•	Efficient for real-world applications (e.g., expert systems, NLP)
❌ Limitations:
	•	Less flexible for inferencing than logic-based methods
